# IsepIA Deep Learning Hackathon

## Goal of the competition

The aim is to improve decision-making within a few hours, so the focus will be on immediate
forecasting. The most interesting parameters in agriculture are temperature, especially
for extreme cold events (frost at a sensitive stage of the crop which can destroy flowers
and therefore future fruits in arboriculture or vines), rainfall, which makes it possible to
control crop irrigation, wind which constrains cultural interventions and can also cause
crop lodging.

## Technologies used

- Python3
- PyTorch : deep learning framework
- Spark - Elastic : flatten and visualize json data

## Potential subjects to explore

1. Can we find signs of the arrival of a given event (e.g. low temperature, below 2°C, rain above 5 mm, other...) by analyzing forecasts and observations.
2. Can we determine with good certainty the most reliable forecast based on past forecasts and observations?
3. Can we integrate observation data into predictive models, but also forecast errors?
4. Propose AI models that can be applied to this data and that are of interest to farmers?
